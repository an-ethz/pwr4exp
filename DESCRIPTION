Description: Provides tools for calculating statistical power and
    determining sample size for a variety of experimental designs used in
    agricultural and biological research, including completely randomized,
    block, and split-plot designs. Supports customized designs and allows
    specification of main effects, interactions, and contrasts for
    accurate power analysis.
